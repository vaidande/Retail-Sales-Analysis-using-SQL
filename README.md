# Retail Sales Analysis - SQL Project

This SQL project focuses on analyzing retail sales data from multiple tables in a database. The project involves data preparation, understanding, and performing various data analysis tasks to gain insights into the retail sales performance.

## Data Preparation & Understanding

1. Total Number of Rows: The project begins by determining the total number of rows in each of the three tables: Transactions, prod_cat_info, and Customer.

2. Count of Returns: This query calculates the total number of transactions that have a return by filtering the transactions with a quantity less than or equal to zero.

3. Date Format Conversion: The dates provided in the datasets are not in the correct format. This query converts the date variables into valid date formats by using the CAST function.

4. Time Range of Transactions: The project determines the time range of the transaction data available for analysis, showing the output in terms of the number of days, months, and years.

5. Product Category for Sub-category "DIY": This query identifies the product category to which the sub-category "DIY" belongs.

## Data Analysis

1. Most Frequently Used Transaction Channel: This query determines the channel that is most frequently used for transactions by grouping the transactions by store type and selecting the store type with the highest count.

2. Count of Male and Female Customers: The project calculates the count of male and female customers in the database by grouping the customers by gender.

3. City with the Maximum Number of Customers: This query identifies the city with the maximum number of customers and displays the count of customers from that city.

4. Number of Sub-categories under Books Category: The project determines the number of sub-categories under the Books category by filtering the product category table based on the Books category.

5. Maximum Quantity of Products Ordered: This query calculates the maximum quantity of products ever ordered by joining the Transactions and prod_cat_info tables.

6. Net Total Revenue in Electronics and Books Categories: This query calculates the net total revenue generated in the Electronics and Books categories by joining the Transactions and prod_cat_info tables.

7. Customers with >10 Transactions (excluding returns): This query identifies the customers who have made more than 10 transactions (excluding returns) by joining the Transactions and Customer tables.

8. Combined Revenue from Electronics and Clothing Categories in Flagship Stores: The project calculates the combined revenue earned from the Electronics and Clothing categories in Flagship stores by joining the Transactions and prod_cat_info tables.

9. Total Revenue from Male Customers in Electronics Category: This query calculates the total revenue generated from male customers in the Electronics category, displaying the total revenue by product sub-category.

10. Percentage of Sales and Returns by Product Sub-category: This query calculates the percentage of sales and returns by product sub-category, displaying only the top 5 sub-categories based on sales.

11. Net Total Revenue by Customers Aged 25 to 35: This query calculates the net total revenue generated by customers aged between 25 to 35 years in the last 30 days of transactions, considering the maximum transaction date available in the data.

12. Product Category with the Max Value of Returns in the Last 3 Months: This query identifies the product category that has seen the maximum value of returns in the last 3 months of transactions.

13. Store Type with the Maximum Products Sold: This query determines the store type that sells the maximum products, considering both the sales amount and quantity sold.

14. Categories with Above Average Revenue: This query identifies the categories for which the average revenue is above the overall average.

15. Average and Total Revenue by Subcategory for Top 5 Categories by Quantity Sold: This query calculates the average and total revenue for each subcategory among the top 5 categories in terms of quantity sold.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights into their sales performance. By leveraging SQL queries and data manipulation techniques, various aspects of the retail sales data are explored and analyzed.
